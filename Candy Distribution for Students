In a school, there is a row of N students,each with their own academic rating.
The teachers want to reward the students with candies, but they have specific rules: 
Minimum Candy Rule: Every student must receive at least one candy. 
Higher Rating, More Candies: Students with a higher academic rating should receive more candies than their neighbors. 
What is the minimum number of candies you must give? 
Input Format:The first and only argument is an integer array A representing the rating of children. 
Output Format:Return an integer representing the minimum candies to be given. 
Example Inputs: Input 1: A = [1, 2] Input 2: A = [1, 5, 2, 1] 
                Output 1: 3         Output 2: 7

def min_candy(a):
    n=len(a)
    c=[1]*n
    #Left to right pass
    for i in range(1,n):
        if a[i]>a[i-1]: c[i]=c[i-1]+1
    #Right to Left pass
    for i in range(n-2,-1,-1):
        if a[i]>a[i+1]:
            c[i]=max(c[i],c[i+1]+1)
    return sum(c)
a=list(map(int,input().split()))
print(min_candy(a))
