Meet Lisa, a project manager who is always planning ahead for her team's tasks and deadlines. She often needs to know what day of the week a specific date will fall on, based on the current day.
For instance, if today is Sunday (which corresponds to 0 in her system), and she wants to know what day of the week the 27th day from today will be, she has created a simple program to provide her with the answer.Here's how Lisa's program works: She assigns numbers to the days of the week:
0 for Sunday
1 for Monday
2 for Tuesday
3 for Wednesday
4 for Thursday
5 for Friday
6 for Saturday
She inputs the current day (e.g., 0 for Sunday). She inputs the number of days into the future she wants to calculate (e.g., 27).
Her program calculates the day of the week for the future date.For example, if Lisa inputs 0 for Sunday and 27 for the number of days, her program will tell her that the 27th day from Sunday will be a Wednesday.
